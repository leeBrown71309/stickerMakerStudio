## Explanation of the files

- **`app/`**: Contains the files for specific Next.js pages. Each file represents a route.
- **`api/trpc/[trpc]`**: This file defines the /api/trpc route, which is the endpoint of the TRPC API It uses the fetch adapter to serve the API
- **`app/home/components`**: List of React components specific to the section **`app/home`**.
- **`app/home/store`**: Store section **`app/home`**.
- **`prisma/`**: Contains the necessary elements such as database migrations and schema
- **`components/`**: Contains React global components that can be reused in different parts of the application.
- **`server/routers`**: This is where you define the different routes/functions of your application.
- **`styles/`**: Includes global styles and Tailwind CSS configuration.
- **`public/`**: Contains publicly accessible static resources.

This project structure helps to maintain well-defined responsibilities for each part of the code, improving readability and ease of maintenance. You can adapt it to suit your needsðŸ˜ŠðŸ‘Œ.
